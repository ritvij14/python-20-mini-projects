This repository contains 20 mini projects which I used to understand and learn Python as a newbie to the language but a software dev who just wants to quickly understand how the basics of the language work.

I made Claude my teacher, it recommended me the 20 projects, and reviewed my code of each project.

This is done to get a hang of python before I get into Deep Learning.
